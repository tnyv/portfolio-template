Old Portofolio Website

This was my first portfolio website that I developed with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, SASS, and PHP. The focus for this project was to hone my skills frontend styling and JavaScript animations. I included it in my list of projects because it taught me a lot of fundamental lessons about web development, such as why it's a good idea to use styling frameworks such as Bootstrap to save time on responsive UI implementations, basic JS DOM element manipulation for UX, and handling form submissions with PHP. The website can be viewed here:

If you'd like to download the project, follow these steps:

1. Download the zip and extract to your computer
2. Open index.html on your browser

Problems I faced during development: 
- One problem was handling responsive design. I had multiple monitors to test my website with and I realized that I constantly had to update my media queries within home.scss to account for the vast number of different screen sizes and pixels. I learned that it is very beneficial to use styling frameworks, such as Bootstrap, to handle responsiveness -- allowing the user more time to focus on building out other features of the website.
- Another problem I faced was learning how to implement scroll animations with JavaScript. I wanted my website to feel interactive as you scrolled, and I did not want to purcahse a license to have that type of feature on my website. So, I decided to build my own scroll-animation system. I had to brute force this technique with trial and error until I got a good grasp of how to manipulate elements to the desired outcomes via JavaScript.
